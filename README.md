This repository will show a few version of user engagement for beauty pages.
# ❤️ Heart Animation Overlay

This project is a simple **HTML/CSS/JavaScript interactive animation** that adds floating heart effects on top of an image when the user clicks to explore. It demonstrates user engagement techniques using animations, overlays, and dynamic DOM manipulation.

## ✨ Features
- Click-to-start overlay with a **call-to-action message** in Spanish.  
- Animated floating hearts (`❤️`) that rise across the screen with randomized positions and speeds.  
- Elegant **overlay dim effect** to focus user attention.  
- Fully responsive for embedding in portfolios, websites, or product showcases.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS3** (animations, overlay, box styling)  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (event handling, dynamic element creation, animation control)

## 🚀 How It Works
1. An image background (`index.html`) is displayed with a dark overlay message:  
   *“¡Haz clic o toca para explorar este fabuloso diseño de uñas!”*  
2. When the user clicks the overlay, it disappears, and the **heart animation starts**.  
3. JavaScript dynamically generates `div.heart` elements, each with a ❤️ emoji that floats upward using CSS keyframes.  
4. Hearts are continuously created and removed, simulating an infinite flow.
